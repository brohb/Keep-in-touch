# Keep-in-touch

A simple app that may serve a mailing list to inform about news and events.
Whenever the user writes an email address inside the text field and clicks on the button, such text will be added to the local database and the count of the users shown in the page will increase. 
Whenever the user clicks on the bottom without filling the text field, an error page will be shown on a different route, otherwise a successful message will be shown to the client and new data will be collected.
