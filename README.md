# Keep-in-touch

A simple app that may serve a mailing list to inform about news and events.
Whenever the user writes an email address inside the text field and clicks on the button, such text will be added to the local database; the count of the users shown in the page will increase at the same time. 
When the text field is empty and the user clicks on the button, an error page will be shown on a different route, otherwise a successful message will be shown.
